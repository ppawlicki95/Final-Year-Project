The submission directory is organised as follows:

Everything can be found in the Final Year Project folder, including the interim reports and proof of concept programs.
All proof of concept programs, including the final project are in the "Final-Year-Project\Programs\" directory.

Project Final report can be found directly in the Final Year Project folder under the name "Project-Final-Report.pdf".

The entire project structure along with the source files and resorces can be found here:

The .apk file for my android application which can be installed on an android device can be found here:
Final-Year-Project\Programs\BalloonsGui\app\release
under the file name: "app-release.apk"

Alternatively the application can be downloaded from the Google Play Store:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=baloons_gui.patrykpawlicki.balloonsgui
https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Patryk+Pawlicki

The first link is linked to the current beta version of the application however the full release is pending for approval. The link may or may not change. If it does; I provided a secondary link which is connected to my developer page on the PlayStore which should contain the app. If that would fail for some reason, the apk is provided, read above.

Additionally the entire directory which I am submitting is also under version control.
It can be viewed here: https://github.com/ppawlicki95/Final-Year-Project

The video of the application running has also been added to the directory.
It can be found under the name "demo.mp4"

The user manual can be found in the Final Year Project directory under the name "User Manual"
